## Introduction to Release Notes and Changelogs

Release notes and changelogs are essential tools for communicating changes to your users:

- **Release Notes**: A detailed description of changes in a specific version
- **Changelogs**: A chronological record of all changes across versions
- **Standardization**: Following industry conventions makes your documentation easier to understand
- **Automation**: Tools can help maintain consistent documentation with minimal effort

When done well, release notes and changelogs help users:
- Understand what's changed between versions
- Decide whether to upgrade
- Find new features they might want to use
- Identify when bugs they've encountered have been fixed

This course will teach you how to create and maintain these important documents for your GitHub projects.
