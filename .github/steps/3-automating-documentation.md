# Step 3: Automating Changelog Updates

Maintaining changelogs manually can be time-consuming. Fortunately, there are several tools and workflows that can help automate this process. In this step, we'll explore how to use GitHub Actions to automatically update your changelog.

## üìù Approaches to automation

There are several approaches to automating changelog generation:

1. **Conventional Commits**: A commit message convention that makes it easier to generate changelogs
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows that can update changelogs based on PRs or commits
3. **Third-party tools**: Tools like `standard-version`, `release-it`, or `auto-changelog`

## üìù Conventional commits format

Conventional Commits use this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Where `type` can be:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or tools

## :keyboard: Task: Update Yyur changelog and create a new GitHub Release

1. Update your CHANGELOG.md file to include a new version:

```markdown
## [0.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- New feature X
- New feature Y

### Fixed
- Issue with Z

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/username/repository/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0
```

2. Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's date
3. Replace `username/repository` with your actual GitHub username and repository name
4. Create a new GitHub release:
   - Tag version: `v0.2.0`
   - Target: main branch
   - Title: "Version 0.2.0"
   - Description: Include detailed, user-friendly release notes
5. Go to the issue you created earlier and comment "automation-understood"

## üìù Further automation

For full automation, you could set up a GitHub Action workflow that:
1. Detects conventional commits
2. Automatically bumps version numbers
3. Updates the changelog
4. Creates GitHub releases

Tools like `release-please`, `semantic-release`, or GitHub's own Release Drafter can help with this automation.
